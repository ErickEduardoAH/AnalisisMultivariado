    "A principal component analysis is concerned with explained the variance  structure of a set of linear combinations whose general objetive its reduce data dimension and interpretation. Algebraically, principal components are a particular linear combination of p random variables $X_1,...,X_p$ that represent a change of basis obtained the new axes by the rotation of the original system. The new axes represent the directions with maximum variability and provides a simple and parsimonious description of the covariance structure.\n",
